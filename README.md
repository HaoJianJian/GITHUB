update  2019.5.23

I tried send an  email using GITHUB app ï¼Œ but failed. 

According to the error report, I know it was detected as spam by the anti-spam service.

Looks like my anti-spam test failed.

I looked through some of the data ,Probably know anti - spam detection principle ,

This indicates that the subject and body of the message need to avoid duplication,

and avoid frequent emailing , That's all .

//******************************************
this program has only one function 

you can focus on the last page 

click on FINISH button will send an email to my mailbox 

 you don't have to fill anything in , Of course you can put you message  in the body !
 
 click the button and the screen will show "successful !!! " ,means send successful 
 
 This program is unfinished , Maybe someday I'll finish it .
